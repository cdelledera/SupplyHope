        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Founded by a group of passionate educators and community leaders,
          SupplyHope began with a simple goal: ensure that no student is left
          behind due to a lack of basic school supplies. Since our start, we’ve
          partnered with local schools, community centers, and generous donors
          to distribute thousands of backpacks filled with learning essentials.
